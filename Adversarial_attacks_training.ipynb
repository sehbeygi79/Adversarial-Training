First, you will train a simple model, ResNet18, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Next, you will learn about two different adversarial attacks: FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) and PGD (Projected Gradient Descent). To enhance your understanding, you will implement the PGD attack from scratch, while the FGSM attack will be implemented using a library. After this, you will use the FGSM attack to generate adversarial examples and then perform adversarial training on the model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Finally, you will compare the performance and robustness of the adversarially trained model with the original model. \n","\n","Good luck!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["##
